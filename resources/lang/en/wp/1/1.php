By 2025, according to expert estimates, global losses could reach $11 trillion, and by 2030 — $90 trillion. This makes it clear that it is unacceptable to strive to increase the scalability of the blockchain by reducing security! In turn, less decentralized projects have greatly discredited themselves by their high centralization and the pursuit of interests primarily of the so-called elites of the project, rather than blockchain communities and libertarian ideals. It turns out to be a kind of "pseudo-centralization". In the eyes of the community, such projects are gaining less and less trust and support for development. Investors are also not eager to develop blockchain projects in which the power of decisive votes is concentrated in the hands of centralized structures (whether they are dominant mining pools of PoW networks, large validators of PoS/DPoS, etc. networks, or the concentration of a large% of project tokens received by the creators or investors of the project in the early stages of project development at very low prices).',

That is, the number of transactions is comparable to the bandwidth of centralized servers.',
