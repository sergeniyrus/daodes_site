  <h4>Distribution of the Remaining 200,000,000 DES (20% of the Issue)</h4>
  <p>The remaining 200,000,000 DES (20% of the total issue) is distributed as follows:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>40,000,000 DES (4%):</strong> Sent to the DES coin liquidity pool paired with coins from List 2, which can be adjusted by the decision of the community. The purchase of coins into the liquidity pools is implemented through the release of stablecoins backed by DES coins. These stablecoins are exchanged for targeted cryptocurrencies, which are subsequently sent to liquidity pools paired with the DES coin. This ensures the liquidity of the DES coin without spilling it into the market, which could lead to a value dump.</li>
      <li><strong>40,000,000 DES (4%):</strong> Paid to the participants of the DES Arena direction.</li>
      <li><strong>80,000,000 DES (8%):</strong> Allocated to the company's reserve fund. Coins from this fund are sold by the decision of the DAO participants for the needs of the project through the exchange of coins from this fund for the project's stablecoins and, subsequently, their sale on the market.</li>
      <li><strong>20,000,000 DES (2%):</strong> Payment to the founders of the project at the first stage of the issue immediately after the launch of the blockchain, distributed as 1% per month of the total number of coins from one participant.</li>
      <li><strong>20,000,000 DES (2%):</strong> Sent to opinion leaders in the crypto industry (based on community suggestions and solutions) in order to gain support for the project and promote it.</li>
  </ul>
