  <h2>Increasing Liquidity and Ensuring the Value of the DES Coin</h2>
  <p>To increase liquidity and ensure the value of the DES coin, 10% of the commissions from the cost of all transactions in the project network will be used to replenish the liquidity pools with the most decentralized coins created at the project launch stage (invested with funds received from investors and the community, which will later receive commissions from exchange transactions in these pools as a reward). The initial list of coins is based on the top 100 from CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko (see Appendix 1 to the Whitepaper).</p>

  <h3>Mechanism for Replenishing Liquidity Pools</h3>
  <p>When the liquidity pool is replenished with coins received from transactions, stablecoins secured with DES tokens will be issued. These stablecoins will then be exchanged for tokens paired with DES tokens in the liquidity pools. This mechanism ensures:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>No Risk of Dumping DES Coins:</strong> By avoiding excessive spilling of DES coins into the market.</li>
      <li><strong>Increased Transaction Fees:</strong> Stimulating growth in the amount of commissions within the project.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Benefits of the Scheme</h3>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Reduction of DES Coin Circulation:</strong> Part of the DES coins will be withdrawn from circulation (see the description of the functioning of stablecoins in the Whitepaper).</li>
      <li><strong>Increased Applicability of Stablecoins:</strong> Stimulating the growth of stablecoin capitalization and improving the tokenomics of the DES coin.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Participation of Other Project Stakeholders</h3>
  <p>Other project participants (activists, validators, delegators, investors, and others) will also be able to replenish these pools using the same scheme. This will:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Increase Their Earnings:</strong> By contributing to the liquidity pools and earning rewards from transaction fees.</li>
      <li><strong>Stimulate Growth in Liquidity and Value of DES Tokens:</strong> Further enhancing their earnings and the overall health of the ecosystem.</li>
  </ul>
