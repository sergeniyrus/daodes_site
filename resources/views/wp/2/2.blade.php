  <h2>An Ecosystem of a Centralized Messenger with a Decentralized Messaging Unit</h2>
  <p>The ecosystem includes the following additions:</p>
  <ol>
      <li><strong>A decentralized cryptocurrency wallet:</strong> With the ability to add new networks and tokens (at the addresses of contracts and other necessary data) with the ability to transfer cryptocurrencies directly inside decentralized chats.</li>
      <li><strong>DPN (Decentralized VPN):</strong> Ensures secure and anonymous network connectivity.</li>
      <li><strong>Decentralized storage:</strong> For secure data storage.</li>
      <li><strong>A decentralized browser:</strong> With the possibility of verification using a cryptocurrency wallet.</li>
      <li><strong>Video hosting (hybrid):</strong> A combination of centralized and decentralized technologies for storing and transmitting video.</li>
      <li><strong>Photo hosting (hybrid):</strong> Similar to video hosting, but for photos.</li>
      <li><strong>Audio hosting (hybrid):</strong> For storing and transmitting audio files.</li>
      <li><strong>NFT-generation of audio, photo, video, and PDF content:</strong> The ability to create NFTs from media files.</li>
      <li><strong>Synchronous audio transfers:</strong> A feature for real-time automatic audio translation.</li>
      <li><strong>Decentralized audio and video calls:</strong> Secure calls through a decentralized network.</li>
      <li><strong>"Portfolio Analyst":</strong> A module that allows you to monitor the trends of portfolio assets in one place, including graphs (thumbnail on the main page and full on the page) and the cost from the moment of purchase in the portfolio and for periods.</li>
      <li><strong>The button for quick transfer of crypts to stables:</strong> Useful in case of a sharp drop in the alt market. To automate the process across the entire portfolio at once.</li>
      <li><strong>"Startup Analyst":</strong> Collects information about projects based on open information on the Internet on startup verification algorithms and assigns a rating to a startup based on this verification. It also collects and analyzes a database of names (to analyze the background of the creators) in the crypto industry.</li>
      <li><strong>To implement the messenger, the source code of the Telegraph messenger will be taken (in part of the centralized messenger section).</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <h3>The Decentralized Section of the Hybrid Messenger DES</h3>
  <p>The decentralized section of the hybrid messenger DES will be based on solutions in accordance with the roadmap of the project:</p>
  <ol>
      <li><strong>A Telegram bot:</strong> Redirects data from decentralized chats to Decentralized Storage via decentralized data transfer nodes (DPNs).</li>
      <li><strong>Adamant open source decentralized messenger:</strong> With DPN-based data exchange and Decentralized Storage DES.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The two sections of the messenger will function completely independently of each other.</p>
