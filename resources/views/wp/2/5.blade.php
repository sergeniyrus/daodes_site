<h4>When designing a decentralized OS, the DES project will focus on the following aspects:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>DES OS eliminates the risks of censorship and data leaks:</strong> All data is encrypted and distributed
        over the network (analogous to IPFS + Tor).</li>
    <li><strong>Logging in through a decentralized wallet eliminates hacking through logins/passwords:</strong> "Imagine
        that you are working with documents in DES OS: Files are automatically encrypted and stored in a decentralized
        repository. Access to the desktop is possible from any device via a DPN tunnel."</li>
    <li><strong>Compatibility with all possible devices:</strong> The system will be designed to work seamlessly across
        smartphones, tablets, PCs, and Smart TVs.</li>
</ul>
