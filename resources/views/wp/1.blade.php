    <p>Here we gather crypto enthusiasts, experts, and ordinary users to unite in creating something new and global in the world of Blockchain on the Internet.</p>

  <h2 class="pros-cons">Introduction to Web3.0</h2>
  <p>To open the doors to the world of web3.0 for everyone, to simplify the task of getting acquainted with and understanding this global change in the Internet for all. To help them avoid mistakes when introducing the new Internet into their lives.</p>
  <p><strong>What mistake does practically every beginner make when starting their journey in crypto technology?</strong> This mistake is the main enemy of the technology itself. It is KYC authorization on exchanges!</p>
  <p>How to buy or receive your first tokens and where to store them? On centralized reliable exchanges in the form of Drops, Launchpads, or simply buy the desired currencies? Perhaps. But by starting your journey this way, you leave an indelible mark.</p>
  <p>In the world of Blockchain on the internet, there is no need for names, surnames, addresses, and document numbers. Here, the only confirmation of your identity should be your public key, your address in the blockchain.</p>
  <p>We do not categorically oppose KYC and centralized services, but everyone should make this choice consciously and not at the very beginning of the path.</p>

  <h2  class="pros-cons">Integrating Telegram with Blockchain</h2>
  <p>To introduce the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency, we suggest combining a product used by over 700 million users (Telegram messenger) with blockchain technology. Integrate into the messenger's base code the ability to:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Create decentralized chats without being tied to the main account.</li>
      <li>Create stablecoins of any world fiat currency, exchange and send them, and many other cryptocurrencies in a couple of clicks.</li>
      <li>Create your own NFTs to confirm copyright for inventions and/or creative content (audio, video, photo files) and store files in a decentralized cloud storage.</li>
      <li>Create your own dApps based on our blockchain and receive rewards from user usage commissions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Everyone can join our DAO and actively participate in creating something new in the world of Blockchain on the internet.</p>

  <h2  class="pros-cons">Our Mission</h2>
  <p>To create our project together, we, as the first small group of enthusiasts, decided to study and take the best of existing offerings in the market. To combine the strongest ideas and solutions into one maximally scalable, decentralized, and secure Blockchain.</p>
  <p>Observing the development of the blockchain industry, it can be noticed that initially, the main emphasis was placed on decentralization and security, which were perfectly provided by PoW blockchains with the network's proper development. Over time, the development of decentralized product ecosystems required an increase in network scalability. The industry began to move in this direction by replacing the poorly scalable PoW consensus with a much more adaptable PoS consensus and its derivatives. However, PoS consensus noticeably suffers in terms of decentralization.</p>
  <p>Thus, different stages of industry development highlight different priorities. In the DES project team, we are convinced that the inevitable upcoming stage of WEB3.0, like the air, requires blockchains that equally address all three problems of the blockchain trilemma, namely:</p>
  <ol>
      <li><strong>Security of network and application operation</strong> (the main feature and advantage of WEB3.0 over WEB2.0);</li>
      <li><strong>High decentralization</strong> (applications, essentially, should use maximally decentralized solutions);</li>
      <li><strong>Network scalability</strong>, allowing to achieve throughput at the level of centralized solutions (for convenience of use and smoothness of interfaces, they must rely on network performance speeds comparable to those of centralized servers).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Most third-generation blockchains declare around 10,000 transactions per second. Some systems claim much higher speeds, but this information is not confirmed upon actual testing (The Solana Network, with a declared speed of 100,000 transactions per second, regularly experiences hang-ups, even with existing (non-peak) loads). To compete, for example, with Visa, it is desirable to achieve a real figure closer to 65,000 transactions per second. Therefore, to prevent the penetration of WEB3.0 from faltering at the very start of its march into the modern world, a multiple increase in the speed of blockchain functioning becomes simply mandatory at this stage of blockchain industry development.</p>
  <p>The DES project is created to address the blockchain trilemma by maintaining the security of the existing network (the DES project uses a Cosmos network fork with global changes (consensus, sharding, Proof of Time module)), and by increasing decentralization through improvements and changes to the DPoS consensus and the rules for distributing votes from Active DAO when making decisions on project development (no more than 8% per activist of the project), awarded not for financial contribution, but for an active stance on issues related to the development of the project's decentralized essence, as well as network scaling through the implementation of sharding.</p>

  <h2  class="pros-cons">Our Goals</h2>
  <p>We strive to create a project that allows:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Newcomers to easily and quickly familiarize themselves with the world of web3.</li>
      <li>Professionals to create quality applications and earn from them (up to 30% of the commissions on their applications).</li>
      <li>Enthusiasts to join the project without any investment using their knowledge and experience, to become part of its asset, even to the extent of joining the project's DAO governing council.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Thus, the goal is to create a fast (up to competitive speeds with current centralized payment systems), secure, decentralized blockchain on an eco-friendly DeDPoS (Decentralized-DPoS) consensus with low fees, making it highly suitable for the development of Web3.0 and dApps.</p>

  <h2  class="pros-cons">DES Ecosystem</h2>
  <p>In addition to this, the DES project is creating its own ecosystem of decentralized products:</p>
  <ul>
      <li><strong>Ecosystem of a centralized messenger</strong> (based on the open-source code of Telegram (with enhancements and additions, including all its existing benefits, including user database) with a decentralized section for secure messaging exchange and the creation of a decentralized ecosystem of add-ons to it.</li>
      <li><strong>Ecosystem of decentralized stablecoins</strong> with a combined algorithmic support mechanism.</li>
      <li><strong>Ecosystem of a decentralized exchange</strong> with spot and futures trading capabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Ecosystem of decentralized operating systems.</strong></li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2  class="pros-cons">DES Token</h2>
  <p>Additionally, the project will have its own utility token DES with deflationary tokenomics, which will be used for:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Algorithmic regulation of the ecosystem support of the project's stablecoin.</li>
      <li>Transaction fees in the blockchain.</li>
      <li>Rewarding project validators.</li>
      <li>Automated payouts to investors, application creators, and project activists.</li>
      <li>Algorithmic filling of insurance and guarantee funds of the project.</li>
      <li>Payouts for airdrops and bounty programs.</li>
  </ul>
