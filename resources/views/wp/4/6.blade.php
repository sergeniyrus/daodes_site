    <h2>DES Arena: Encouraging Activity in the DES Ecosystem</h2>
    <p>The DES Arena module is designed to encourage active participation in the DES project ecosystem. Participants can
        compete in various disciplines to win DES coins, DESS stablecoins, or rewards from project partners.</p>

    <h3>Overview of the DES Arena</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Competitions:</strong> Participants can compete in disciplines such as logo design, website design,
            code development, and more. Any activity with more than 10 participants can become a competition.</li>
        <li><strong>DAO Structure:</strong> A DAO (DES-Arena) is created, overseen by an "Olympic Council" (founders and
            holders of DAO tokens).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Joining a Discipline:</strong> Community members can join an existing discipline by filling out a
            form with their network nickname, chosen discipline, and initial work submission.</li>
        <li><strong>Creating a New Discipline:</strong> Members can propose new disciplines by submitting a detailed
            description of the discipline's usefulness to the community, along with text and presentation materials.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Community Approval:</strong> New disciplines require at least 10 votes of support from community
            activists to proceed to the participant search phase.</li>
        <li><strong>Voting:</strong> The winner is chosen by the community. Each network participant can vote once per
            reporting period (weekly or monthly). Voting participation increases the participant's activity rating
            (based on SBT).</li>
        <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Winners are awarded 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place rewards each reporting period.
            Participants who consistently rank in the top 3 for five reporting periods gain the opportunity to join the
            Olympic Council with minimal voting power.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Discipline Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discipline Closure:</strong> If no new participants join a discipline after three rounds (five
            periods each), the Council may vote to close the discipline. A smart contract flags suspicious conditions
            for Council review.</li>
        <li><strong>Exclusion of Participants:</strong> The Council can nominate participants for exclusion if they are
            found to bypass smart contract rules through prior arrangements. Proofs are submitted to the community's
            expert court for review.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Funding for Rewards</h3>
    <p>Funds for participant rewards are sourced from a percentage of the transaction fees in the project, specifically
        allocated to encourage activists.</p>
