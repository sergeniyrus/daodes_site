  <p>The modern world requires more and more mobility. At first, desktop personal computers were popular, then laptops began to gain popularity, then tablets and smartphones. People want to carry all the information with them and have access to it at almost any moment.</p>
  <p>Another important point is the need for secure use of information.</p>
  <p>The optimal solution to both issues at the same time would be to provide users with the opportunity to access all their resources using the minimum size of the storage medium, running the management of your data and resources from anywhere in the world in a decentralized manner (using DPN) and verification in this system using a decentralized wallet. It is precisely such an operating system that the DAO DES project plans to implement.</p>
